## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The platform's engineering foundation is mature. The next phase is **Product Experience** — how the platform educates, guides, converts, and retains users across every page, component, copy, and interaction.

This document synthesizes:

- **Internal**: All existing strategy, product, brand, and architecture docs
- **External**: Research on Stripe, Linear, Notion, Atlassian, Cvent, Bizzabo, Supabase, GitHub, and the global B2B SaaS benchmarks
- **Market**: Indonesia-specific context (Xendit, Mayar.id) + enterprise procurement psychology

**Core Thesis:** The gap between a good platform and a great one is not features — it is clarity, trust, and the ability to make users feel competent from Day 1.

# PART 1: WORLD-CLASS B2B SaaS EXPERIENCE BENCHMARK

## 1.1 Homepage Architecture — What World-Class Looks Like

### Stripe

- **IA Philosophy**: Evolved from "developer payment tool" to "economic engine of the internet"
- **Pattern**: "Bento box" modular card layout — showcases multiple features without overwhelming
- **Copy style**: Sharp, trust-first. GDP counter on homepage = proof, not marketing
- **Lesson for us**: Lead with _operational outcomes_ (reliability, visibility, accountability), then support with architecture proof. Never lead with "immutable ledger" — lead with "no dropped balls."

### Linear

- **IA Philosophy**: "The product development system for teams and agents"
- **Pattern**: Dark mode, bold typography, extreme minimalism — premium feel without visual noise
- **Copy style**: Plain language, purpose-driven. Every word earns its place.
- **Lesson for us**: Opinionated UX is a feature. Don't be afraid to say "this is how professional ops teams work." Our Stoic UX is our Linear Aesthetic.

### Notion

- **IA Philosophy**: Flexible starting point, grows with you
- **Pattern**: Hero → Use cases → Templates → Customer stories → Pricing
- **Lesson for us**: Show users _what they'll build_, not just _what the product does_. Use templates and playbooks as conversion tools.

### Atlassian

- **IA Philosophy**: Suite of tools, unified by team outcomes
- **Pattern**: Solutions by team type (Engineering, IT, Business) — not by product name
- **Lesson for us**: Organize by _who needs it_ + _what they're trying to do_, not by feature module names. COO thinks in outcomes, not in "AccessPass management."

### GitHub / Supabase / Vercel

- **IA Philosophy**: Developer-first, community-powered
- **Pattern**: Docs are a product. Search is primary. Code examples are first-class citizens.
- **Lesson for us**: The developer portal is a conversion surface. If our API docs are hard to navigate, we lose technical evaluators before they see value.

# PART 2: EVENT & PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLATFORM BENCHMARK

## 2.1 Competitive Content & Education Analysis

### Cvent

- **Strength**: Deep feature documentation, certification programs (Cvent Academy)
- **Weakness**: UX complexity → learning curve → poor activation rates for non-enterprise
- **Content Pattern**: Formal whitepapers, ROI calculators, comparison guides
- **Gap we can exploit**: Cvent is hard to adopt. We can win on _time-to-first-value_ and _clarity of onboarding_.

### Bizzabo

- **Strength**: Modern interface, B2B event focus, clean content marketing
- **Weakness**: Less depth in finance/operations than enterprise needs
- **Content Pattern**: Experience-focused messaging, data-driven event ROI content
- **Gap we can exploit**: No deep financial audit trail, no project management integration. We have both.

### Whova

- **Strength**: Easy to use, strong attendee engagement, quick adoption
- **Weakness**: Limited enterprise-grade finance, no project context, no spatial resource management
- **Content Pattern**: Simple, friendly UI-focused marketing

### Monday / Asana / Linear

- **Strength**: Superb task and project UX
- **Weakness**: No event commerce, no venue/resource spatial booking, no immutable financial ledger
- **Content Pattern**: Strong use-case and team-type pages

### Plane / OpenProject (OSS)

- **Strength**: Open-source credibility, developer communities
- **Weakness**: No commercial-grade support, no event-specific capabilities
- **Content Pattern**: GitHub presence, community-driven

## 2.2 Market Gap Summary (Our Opportunity)

The market has:

- Event tools without deep finance or project context
- Project tools without event commerce or spatial resource management
- ERPs without real-time spatial, AI guardrails, or modern UX

**Our unique position**: The only platform combining:

1. Event operations (scheduling, access passes, ticketing)
2. Project management (tasks, workflows, approvals)
3. Spatial resource management (conflict-free venue/room booking)
4. Immutable financial ledger (audit-grade)
5. AI assistance with human approval guardrails (L-06)
6. Multi-tenant enterprise architecture (data sovereignty)

# PART 3: ENTERPRISE-GRADE WEBSITE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE

## 3.1 IA Design Principles

> Pages exist because **users need them**, not because competitors have them.

Every page answers:

1. **Why does this exist?** — What problem does it solve
2. **Who needs it?** — Specific persona
3. **When do they visit?** — Stage in journey
4. **What decision should they make afterward?** — Clear next action

# PART 4: CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAP

## 4.1 Full Journey — Stages, Questions, Content, CTA

### Stage 0: Unknown Visitor

- **Trigger**: Googled a pain point ("event management chaos"), saw LinkedIn post, referral
- **State of mind**: Curious but skeptical. Not looking for a platform yet.
- **Questions**: "Is this even for me? What is this platform?"
- **Pain points**: Too many tools; coordination chaos; audit failures
- **Content needed**: Homepage hero copy, blog on pain points, social proof
- **Best UI**: Clean homepage, fast LCP (<1.5s), zero friction to understand value
- **CTA**: "See how it works" (short demo video, no signup required)

### Stage 1: Problem Aware

- **Trigger**: Recurring coordination failures, upcoming compliance audit, growing event volume
- **State of mind**: Frustrated. Looking for diagnosis, not yet solution.
- **Questions**: "Why do our events always run over budget? Why can't teams see the same information?"
- **Pain points**: Manual reconciliation, missed communications, no audit trail
- **Content needed**: Blog articles, diagnostic guides, industry reports, problem-framing pages
- **Best UI**: SEO-optimized blog, pillar + cluster content, FAQ schema
- **CTA**: "Download the Operations Chaos Report" (gated lead magnet)

### Stage 2: Solution Aware

- **Trigger**: Researching categories — "event management software," "project operations platform"
- **State of mind**: Evaluating categories and approaches
- **Questions**: "What kind of tool do I need? ERP? Event tool? PM tool? Something else?"
- **Content needed**: Category definition page, compare pages, solution overview
- **Best UI**: Solutions page (by role + industry), comparison tables, testimonials
- **CTA**: "Compare platforms" → "Watch a 5-min demo"

### Stage 3: Product Aware

- **Trigger**: Found us through search, referral, or comparison site
- **State of mind**: Evaluating us specifically. Multi-stakeholder. Risk-averse.
- **Questions**: "Can this replace our current stack? How does pricing work? Is it secure? Can it integrate with our systems?"
- **Pain points**: Switching cost anxiety, data security concerns, internal buy-in
- **Content needed**: Feature pages, security/trust center, customer stories, pricing, ROI calculator
- **Best UI**: Detailed feature pages, trust signals prominent, pricing transparent
- **CTA**: "Request a demo" / "Start free trial" / "Talk to sales"

### Stage 4: Trial / Evaluation

- **Trigger**: Signed up, requested demo
- **State of mind**: Skeptical optimism. Want to see it work for their specific problem.
- **Questions**: "How do I get started? Will this actually work for our use case?"
- **Pain points**: Onboarding friction, blank slate syndrome, unclear first steps
- **Content needed**: Interactive onboarding, guided tours, sample data, templates
- **Best UI**: Onboarding checklist (like Linear's getting started), progress indicators, AI Copilot guidance
- **CTA**: "Create your first event / project" (guided)

### Stage 5: Activation (Aha! Moment)

- **Definition**: User has successfully run their first event or project with the platform and experienced the value
- **Target**: ≤ 72 hours from signup to first "real" activity
- **Aha! Moments by persona**:
  - Ops Manager: "I can see all events in one calendar with no conflicts"
  - Finance: "Every transaction has an audit trail I can export"
  - Developer: "The API docs are actually clear and the sandbox works"
- **Content needed**: In-app tooltips, contextual help, success messages
- **Best UI**: Empty states with clear CTAs, progress celebrations, AI suggestions

### Stage 6: Daily Usage

- **State of mind**: Platform is part of workflow. Evaluating depth and ROI.
- **Questions**: "How do I do [advanced task]? Can I set up this workflow automatically?"
- **Content needed**: Advanced guides, video tutorials, keyboard shortcut references, API docs
- **Best UI**: Command palette (Cmd+K), contextual help sidebar, AI Copilot in context
- **CTA**: Upgrade prompts (usage-based), invite team members

### Stage 7: Expansion

- **Trigger**: Team grows, more events added, new departments interested
- **State of mind**: Looking to scale. Finance now involved in decision.
- **Questions**: "What's the enterprise plan? Can we get dedicated support? Can I invite my whole team?"
- **Content needed**: Enterprise page, partner program, volume pricing
- **Best UI**: Team management features, role-based access, admin console
- **CTA**: "Upgrade to Enterprise" / "Talk to sales"

### Stage 8: Advocate

- **Trigger**: Platform has become critical infrastructure. High satisfaction.
- **Content needed**: Case study request, referral program, community invitation
- **Best UI**: NPS survey in-app, "Share your story" CTA, referral dashboard
- **CTA**: "Share your story" / "Join our community" / "Refer a colleague"

# PART 7: COPYWRITING SYSTEM

## 7.1 Voice & Tone Framework

### Brand Voice

Inspired by Linear's clarity + Stripe's authority + Supabase's approachability

| Dimension       | Description                                              | Example                                                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Confident**   | We know what we're doing. Direct, no hedging.            | "Run events without dropped balls." NOT "We try to help you..."                                        |
| **Clear**       | Simple language. Professionals want clarity, not jargon. | "See every booking conflict before it happens." NOT "Leverage our AI-powered spatial conflict engine." |
| **Human**       | We talk like people, not corporations.                   | "Your team spent 3 hours reconciling that budget. You shouldn't have to."                              |
| **Trustworthy** | We prove claims with specifics, not adjectives.          | "Every transaction has a timestamp, actor ID, and trace." NOT "Best-in-class audit capabilities."      |
| **Focused**     | We're for operations teams. Not everyone.                | "Built for teams that run real operations."                                                            |

### Tone by Context

| Context            | Tone                              | Example                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Homepage hero**  | Confident, bold                   | "Run events and projects without the chaos."                                                    |
| **Feature page**   | Explanatory, precise              | "Bookings are stored with a GiST index that prevents conflicts at the database level."          |

## 7.3 UX Microcopy Standards

### Empty States

Formula: `[Entity icon] + [Short title] + [Context sentence] + [Action CTA]`

- "No events yet. Create your first event to bring your team together."
- "No access passes issued. Publish your event to start issuing passes."

### Error Messages

Formula: `[What happened] + [Why] + [What to do]`

- ✅ "Booking failed. Room A102 is unavailable from 10:00–12:00 on July 3. Select a different time or room."
- ❌ "An error occurred. Please try again."

### Success Messages

Formula: `[What happened] + [What happens next (optional)]`

- "Event created. Your team will receive a notification."
- "Payment captured. Receipt sent to customer's email."

### Loading States

Formula: `[Active verb]...`

- "Loading calendar..." NOT "Please wait..."
- "Saving..." NOT "Processing request..."

### Form Labels

Formula: `[Noun phrase, title case]` — Never questions, never jargon

- ✅ "Event Name" / "Start Date" / "Venue"
- ❌ "What do you want to call this event?" / "GeoCoordinate Location"

### Placeholders

- Use for format hints only, not instructions
- ✅ "YYYY-MM-DD" / "events@company.com"
- ❌ "Enter your event name here"

# PART 8: UX WRITING GUIDELINES

## 8.1 The Interface Test (Extended)

> "If an operations manager is solving a crisis at 11 PM, does this copy help or slow them down?"

## 8.2 Writing Principles

1. **Outcome-first** — Lead with what the user achieves, not what the system does
2. **Specific over vague** — "47 events coordinated" > "many events"
3. **Active voice** — "Create an event" > "An event can be created"
4. **Progressive disclosure** — Show simple first, reveal detail on demand
5. **Consistent terminology** — Use the Ubiquitous Language from Layer-1 (AccessPass, Booking, Supplier, Facility, TicketType, Workflow). Never improvise synonyms.

## 8.3 Forbidden Patterns

- **Never** use: "robust," "seamless," "powerful," "game-changing," "revolutionary," "innovative"
- **Never** expose internal architecture terms in UI copy: "immutable ledger," "hexagonal architecture," "DDD," "bounded context"
- **Never** write vague error messages: "Something went wrong"
- **Never** write empty empty states: just show a blank screen with no guidance

## 8.4 Terminology Reference (Mandatory — from Layer-1 Ubiquitous Language)

| ✅ Use     | ❌ Never use                                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| AccessPass | Ticket, Token, Pass                                |
| Booking    | Reservation, Appointment, Order                    |
| Supplier   | Vendor, Provider                                   |
| Facility   | Space, Location, Venue (unless geographic context) |
| TicketType | TicketTier, PassType                               |
| Workflow   | Process, Flow                                      |
| Tenant     | Organization, Company, Client (in API context)     |

---

# PART 9: COMPONENT LIBRARY (CONTENT)

## 9.1 Marketing Site Components

### Hero

- **Structure**: Eyebrow tag → H1 (Problem/outcome) → Supporting subhead → CTA pair → Social proof strip
- **Content rules**: H1 ≤ 8 words. Subhead ≤ 25 words. CTA pair = primary + secondary.
- **Example**: "Run Events Without the Chaos" / "One platform for event coordination, project management, finance, and audit — built for operations teams."

### Problem Section

- **Purpose**: Name the pain before showing the solution
- **Structure**: Problem statement + 3 pain pillars (icon + label + 1 sentence)
- **Tone**: Empathetic, not alarmist

### Benefits Grid (Bento)

- **Structure**: 2–3 column card grid, each card: icon + headline + 1–2 sentences + optional screenshot
- **Content rules**: Benefit-first (not feature-first). "See every conflict before it happens" not "GiST-indexed spatial booking."

### Comparison Table

- **Structure**: Feature rows × competitor columns
- **Content rules**: Be fair and accurate. Only compare on genuine differentiators.

### Workflow Diagram

- **Purpose**: Show how work actually flows through the platform
- **Format**: Step-by-step numbered flow or swimlane diagram

### Customer Story Card

- **Structure**: Logo + quote (25–40 words) + person name + role + company + industry tag
- **Rules**: Quote must be specific, outcome-focused ("We cut reconciliation time by 60%" > "We love the platform")

### Metrics / Proof Bar

- **Structure**: 3–4 key metrics in a horizontal strip
- **Example**: "500+ events coordinated / 99.9% uptime / 10,000+ bookings processed"

### FAQ Component

- **Structure**: Accordion, question-first
- **Content rules**: Write questions the way buyers actually ask them. Use schema markup.

### Pricing Table

- **Structure**: 3 tiers (Free/Pro/Enterprise), feature grid, CTA per tier
- **Rules**: Show value per tier clearly. Don't hide limits. Include ROI calculator link.

### Trust Banner

- **Structure**: Horizontal strip of security badges/certifications
- **Content**: SOC 2, GDPR-ready, ISO 27001 (when applicable), uptime %, encryption

### Compliance Badge

- **Per-badge tooltip**: Explains what each certification means in plain language

# PART 14: BLOG STRATEGY

## 14.1 Content Pillars

| Pillar                      | Topics                                                         | SEO Intent     | Persona          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Operations Intelligence** | How to run events without chaos, coordination best practices   | Problem-aware  | Ops Manager      |
| **Finance & Compliance**    | Audit trails, financial accuracy for events, compliance guides | Problem-aware  | Finance          |
| **AI in Operations**        | Safe AI use, L-06 guardrails, practical AI for ops teams       | Solution-aware | CTO, Ops Manager |
| **Industry Playbooks**      | Corporate events, university events, venue operations          | Solution-aware | Industry buyer   |

## 14.2 Blog Content Formats

- **Long-form guides** (2,500–5,000 words): Pillar content, evergreen, SEO-optimized
- **How-to articles** (800–1,500 words): Task-focused, instructional
- **Opinion / thought leadership** (1,000–2,000 words): Named author, original perspective
- **Data reports** (1,000–2,500 words + data visualizations): Original research, highly shareable

---

# PART 15: SEO / AEO / GEO STRATEGY

## 15.1 Integrated Discoverability Framework

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

- **Technical foundation**: Page speed (LCP <2s), mobile-first, structured data, canonical tags
- **Topical authority**: 5 content clusters (Event Operations, Project Management, Venue Management, Financial Audit, AI in Operations)
- **Pillar + cluster**: Each pillar page links to 8–12 supporting articles
- **Internal linking**: Every article links to relevant feature/solution pages

### AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)

- **FAQ schema** on all pricing, help, and feature pages
- **HowTo schema** on all guide/tutorial pages
- **SoftwareApplication schema** on product pages
- **Answer-first writing**: Lead every article with the direct answer in the first paragraph
- **Voice-friendly**: Short, specific answers (≤40 words) for featured snippets

### GEO (Generative Engine Optimization — LLM Optimization)

- **`llms.txt` file**: Structured summary of platform for AI crawlers
- **Entity consistency**: Platform name, feature names, and canonical terminology used consistently across all pages and third-party mentions
- **Authoritative data**: Publish original research and statistics (models prefer citing data)
- **Structured content**: Use HTML tables, numbered lists, and clear headings — LLMs synthesize structured content better
- **"Prompt Universe" coverage**: Answer the questions that buyers ask AI assistants before visiting websites
  - "What's the best platform for managing corporate events with financial tracking?"
  - "How do I build an audit-grade event management system?"
  - "Cvent vs alternatives for enterprise event operations"

## 15.2 Keyword Strategy

| Cluster            | Primary Keywords                                                          | Supporting Keywords                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event Operations   | event operations platform, event management software enterprise           | multi-event coordination, venue booking system, event audit trail |
| Project Management | project operations software, project event management                     | project coordination platform, operations project management      |
| Financial Audit    | event financial management, audit-grade operations, event budget tracking | event reconciliation software, event compliance platform          |
| AI Operations      | AI event management, AI project coordination                              | safe AI for operations, AI approval workflow                      |
| Venue/Facility     | facility booking system, venue management software                        | resource scheduling software, conflict-free booking               |

---

# PART 16: CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION REPORT

## 16.1 Enterprise Conversion Framework

### Trust Signals That Convert

1. **Compliance badges above fold** — SOC 2, GDPR immediately visible
2. **Named customer logos** — Real companies, not "customers include..."
3. **Specific metrics** — "99.9% uptime" not "highly reliable"
4. **Transparent pricing** — Enterprise anxiety peaks at hidden pricing
5. **Quick-response promise** — "Demo within 24 hours" reduces hesitation

### Objection Pre-emption Matrix

| Objection                   | Where they raise it        | Content that resolves it                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Too expensive"             | Pricing page               | ROI calculator + cost-of-chaos comparison                     |
| "Too complex to implement"  | Feature pages, demo        | Implementation timeline guide, "up in 2 weeks" case study     |
| "Not secure enough"         | Security/Trust Center      | SOC 2 summary, architecture diagram, penetration test summary |
| "We already have tools"     | Solutions pages            | "Replace your stack" comparison table + migration guide       |
| "Team won't adopt it"       | Onboarding, training pages | Guided onboarding timeline, Academy resources                 |
| "We can't migrate our data" | Implementation page        | "How migration works" guide + data export formats             |

### Pricing Psychology

- Use anchor pricing: Show Enterprise as aspirational, make Pro feel reasonable
- Show the cost of NOT having the platform (opportunity cost framing)
- "Free" tier removes risk from self-directed evaluation
- Annual pricing = 20% discount = natural upgrade incentive

---

# PART 17: TRUST & CREDIBILITY FRAMEWORK

## 17.1 Trust Ecosystem Architecture

### Layer 1: Technical Trust

- SOC 2 Type II certification (priority)
- ISO 27001 (roadmap)

- Tenant data isolation (RLS — L-05)
- AI approval workflow (L-06 — AI only proposes, human approves)
- Soft delete — no data loss (L-03)

### Layer 3: Social Trust

- Named customer stories with specific metrics
- Partner ecosystem (implementation partners)
- Open source contributions (if applicable — builds community trust)
- Transparent changelog and roadmap
- Responsive community and support

### Layer 4: Business Trust

- Clear pricing (no hidden fees)
- Data portability (export in standard formats)
- No vendor lock-in architecture (open standards)
- Clear cancellation policy
- Dedicated CSM for Enterprise

---

# PART 18: INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (UPDATED)

## 18.1 IA Principles

1. **User-needs first** — Every section exists because a specific persona needs it at a specific journey stage
2. **Single source of truth** — No duplicate information across sections
3. **Progressive disclosure** — Simple overview → detail on demand
4. **Audience-segmented** — Different paths for Ops, Finance, Developer, IT Admin
5. **AI-optimized** — Structured for both human navigation and LLM indexing

## 18.2 Navigation System Design

### Primary Navigation (7 items max)

`Platform` | `Solutions` | `Pricing` | `Resources` | `Docs` | `[Sign in]` | `[Start Free]`

### Mega Menu Principles

- Organize by **outcome**, not by feature name
- Include visual thumbnails for major categories
- Show "Featured" items (most popular or contextually relevant)
- Include search within mega menu

### Breadcrumb System

- Full path: `Home > Solutions > Event Organizers`
- Schema markup for SEO
- Consistent across all pages

---

# PART 19: NAVIGATION SYSTEM

## 19.1 Navigation by User Type

### First-time visitor path

`Home → Solutions (by role/industry) → Feature page → Pricing → Request Demo`

### Returning evaluator path

`Direct link → Trust Center / Security → Customer story → Pricing → Start Trial`

### Developer evaluator path

`Home → Developer Portal → API Docs → Sandbox → Pricing`

### Existing user path (in-product)

`Dashboard → Docs → Help Center → Support`

---

# PART 20: DESIGN CONTENT PATTERNS

## 20.1 In-Product Experience

### Onboarding Checklist (inspired by Linear)

```
Getting Started (5 steps)
☐ Create your organization
☐ Set up your first event
☐ Configure your venue/facility
☐ Invite your team
☐ Run your first report
```

### Empty State Pattern

```
[Contextual icon]
[Short title: "No events yet"]
[1-sentence context: "Events you create will appear here"]
[Primary CTA: "Create Event"]
[Secondary: "Browse templates"]
```

### AI Copilot Suggestions (L-06 compliant)

- Always show as "suggestion" not "action"
- Requires explicit human confirmation
- Shows confidence level + source
- "AI suggested this booking based on past patterns. Review and approve."

### Command Palette (Cmd+K)

- Search across all entities
- Quick create (new event, new booking, new task)
- Navigation shortcuts
- Recent items

## APPENDIX A: KEY DECISIONS REQUIRED

> These require team input before implementation:

1. **Platform name** — The current "neutral" approach needs a final brand name before Phase 1 homepage launch
2. **Self-host vs SaaS launch order** — Which goes first? Affects developer portal priority
3. **Free tier scope** — What's included? Determines bottom-up PLG effectiveness
4. **Indonesia vs global first** — Language, localization, and regional trust signals (Xendit/Midtrans integration vs Stripe)
5. **Certification timeline** — SOC 2 Type II needs months of preparation; drives Trust Center launch

_This document is the strategic foundation for the Product Experience phase. It aligns with and extends the existing brand, product, and strategy documents. All canonical terminology follows Layer-1 Ubiquitous Language. When in conflict with specific volume content, this document prevails only in marketing/product context — engineering implementation still follows Layer-1 > Layer-2 > Layer-3._

_Next action: Create implementation task list in task.md and begin Phase 1 execution._
