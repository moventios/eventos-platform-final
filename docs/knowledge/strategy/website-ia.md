# Website Information Architecture

## Moventios

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 2026  
**Authority:** product-experience-research.md Part 3 | docs/strategy/information-architecture.md  
**Owner:** Product + Content

> **Principle:** Pages exist because users need them — not because competitors have them.  
> Every page must answer: Why does this exist? Who needs it? When? What decision follows?

---

## 1. IA Design Principles

1. **User-needs first** — Every section exists because a specific persona needs it at a specific journey stage
2. **Single source of truth** — No duplicate information across sections
3. **Progressive disclosure** — Simple overview → detail on demand
4. **Audience-segmented** — Different entry paths for Ops, Finance, Developer, IT Admin
5. **AI-optimized** — Structured for both human navigation and LLM indexing (GEO)
6. **Indonesia-ready** — Bilingual where needed; local payment/compliance references
